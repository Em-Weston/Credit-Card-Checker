## Introduction
I am creating a credit card checker. This will check the validty of any credit card number passed to it. 
I am using the Luhn algorithm to return a true or false value. It will also find the company that issued the faluty card. 

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Javascript 
* Git
* GitHub
* Node.js

## Setup 


## Project Status
I have created the first function, which takes an array, and returns true or false. There is probally a better way to run this function.
